This is one of the key areas when working with new managers, or those more experienced but considered to be ineffective. The ability to get things done with and through others is an important leadership quality.

> If you want something done properly, do it yourself.

Often new managers are promoted to the role because they are the “best” at what they do – selling, coding, designing, accounting etc. The impulse for them to continue doing what they do best is strong. In many cases, trusting others to do a good job is something that needs to be developed.

But effective delegation, which is an important part of leadership judgement, empowers and develops staff, increases motivation, job satisfaction and loyalty – and saves the leader time.
